## Examples

<Info>
Here are some common scenarios for using issue assignment and tracking:
</Info>

### Assigning a Critical Issue
A developer discovers a critical security vulnerability in the codebase. They create an issue and assign it to the lead security engineer for immediate attention.

### Marking an Issue as False Positive
After investigating a reported issue, a team member determines that it is a false positive. They update the issue status to "false positive" and provide an explanation in the comment section.

### Prioritizing Overdue Issues
A project manager filters the user inbox to view only overdue issues. They prioritize these issues based on severity and assign them to available team members for resolution.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
- Regularly review and update issue statuses to ensure accurate tracking
- Encourage team members to provide clear and concise comments when updating issue statuses
- Leverage the user inbox filters to prioritize and focus on critical or overdue issues
- Foster a culture of accountability by consistently assigning issues to responsible team members
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
- If you encounter issues with assigning or updating issues, ensure that you have the necessary permissions
- If email notifications are not being received, check your spam or junk folder, and verify your email settings
- If you experience any other issues, consult the support documentation or contact the support team for assistance
