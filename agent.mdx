## Overview

Corgea Agent is an AI-powered assistant that helps you manage security vulnerabilities in your codebase. It provides two main interaction modes:

1. **Web Chat Interface** - An interactive chat for exploring security issues, scans, and vulnerability data
2. **Pull Request Comments** - Automated responses to commands in PR comments across GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before enabling Corgea Agent, ensure you have:

- Active Corgea account with appropriate plan access
- At least one integration configured (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, or Bitbucket)
- Webhook events properly configured for your repository

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Permissions">
    Ensure your Corgea integration has necessary permissions to:
    - Read pull request comments
    - Post comments on pull requests
    - Access repository content
    
    Check your integration settings to confirm webhooks are active.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Connection">
    - Create a test PR with a security issue
    - Comment `hello` on any vulnerability in the PR to verify the agent responds
    - Access the web chat interface to ask a question about your scans
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What You Can Do

The Corgea Agent has deep knowledge of your security posture and can help you:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Explore Security Issues" icon="bug">
    Get detailed information about specific vulnerabilities, understand severity levels, and review fix suggestions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analyze Scans" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Review scan results and summaries, compare scans over time, and understand scan coverage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Query Vulnerability Data" icon="database">
    List issues by severity, project, or type, and review blocking rules and policy violations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Queries

```plaintext Example Chat Queries
"Show me all critical issues in my latest scan"
"What are the details for issue abc-123?"
"List all SQL injection vulnerabilities in project XYZ"
"Explain the security implications of CVE-2024-12345"
"What blocking rules are currently active?"
```

<img src="/images/agent/web_agent_view_chat_session.png" alt="Example Chat Session with Corgea Agent" />

<Tip>
  Be specific in your queries for better results. Reference issue IDs, scan IDs, or project names directly for more accurate responses.
</Tip>

## Pull Request Interactions

### How It Works

When Corgea detects security issues in a pull request, the agent automatically:

1. Posts comments highlighting the vulnerabilities
2. Monitors the PR for developer responses
3. Interprets developer intent from comments
4. Takes automated actions based on commands

<img src="/images/agent/agent_in_github.png" alt="Corgea Agent in GitHub Pull Request" />

### Triggering the Agent

The agent responds to comments that:

- Explicitly mention `@Corgea`
- Reply directly to Corgea's issue comment
- Contain recognizable action commands
- Are directed at addressing security findings

<Note>
  You don't need to use `@Corgea` as the agent will respond to comments to it's own.
</Note>
