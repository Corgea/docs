## A letter from the Corgea team

Welcome to Corgea,

Corgea is an AI-powered application security agent platform built for developers. We help you find and fix security vulnerabilities in your code with precision and speed. In developer terms, think of Corgea as an **AI-powered security agent** that integrates directly into your workflow.

<Info>
Corgea is different. We built a developer-first security platform that delivers precise findings, clear explanations, and actionable fixes—all integrated into the tools and workflows you already use.
</Info>

We built Corgea because application security tools were designed for security teams, not developers. Yet developers are the ones responsible for securing their applications. This disconnect creates friction, noise, and wasted time.

Our AI doesn't just detect vulnerabilities; it understands your code's context, reduces false positives, and generates fixes that actually work. What makes Corgea special is our use of advanced AI combined with static code analysis to detect and fix hard-to-find vulnerabilities—including business logic flaws, authentication issues, and complex code vulnerabilities that traditional tools miss.

We're excited to have you here and to be part of your security journey.

Sincerely,

[The Corgea Team](https://corgea.com/about)

## What can Corgea do?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI-native SAST (BLAST)" icon="radar">
    Our flagship scanner uses advanced AI to detect security vulnerabilities that traditional SAST tools miss. BLAST excels at finding:
    - **Business logic vulnerabilities**: Authentication flaws, authorization issues, and complex business logic bugs
    - **Code vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and 100+ other vulnerability types
    - **Context-aware detection**: Understands your code's context to minimize false positives
