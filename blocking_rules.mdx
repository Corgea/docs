## Overview

### What it Does

Blocking rules are powerful guardrails that allow you to define specific conditions under which pull requests should be blocked from being merged. This helps ensure that your codebase adheres to your organization's security and quality standards by preventing potentially risky or non-compliant code changes from being merged.

### Who it's For

Blocking rules are primarily designed for:
- Development teams
- Project managers 
- Security professionals

This feature is particularly useful for organizations with strict compliance requirements or those working on mission-critical applications where code quality and security are paramount.

## Key Features and Benefits

## How it Works with GitHub

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You must have installed and configured the [Corgea GitHub App](github) with appropriate repository permissions.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull Request Submission">
    Developer submits a pull request with code changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Analysis">
    System analyzes code changes against active blocking rules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rule Validation">
    If violations are found, pull request is automatically blocked
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/blocking_rules_pr_blocked.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Developer Notification">
    Developer receives detailed notification about rule violations
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/blocking_rules_pr_details.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Developer must fix violations and mark them as Fixed, or mark them as False Positive or Accepted Risk before merge is allowed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it Works with Azure DevOps

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Make sure the [Azure DevOps integration](azure_devops) with Corgea is configured and you have the necessary permissions.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull Request Submission">
    A developer submits a pull request with code changes in Azure DevOps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Analysis">
    The system evaluates the code changes against the active blocking rules set in Corgea.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rule Validation">
    If violations are found, the pull request is automatically blocked.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/azure_blocking_rules_pr_blocked.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    Developer cannot merge the PR until it is resolved. 
     <Frame>
      <img src="/images/azure-devops_merging_blocked.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Developer Notification">
    The developer receives a link to view detailed information about the failed issues on the Corgea Scan page.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/azure_see_details_of_issues.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    The developer must resolve the violations by fixing them or marking them as False Positive or Accepted Risk before the merge can proceed.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Usage Guide

### Creating a New Blocking Rule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Creation">
    Click the "Add Blocking Rule" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Basic Information">
    Enter rule name and description
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/blocking_rule_create.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Select urgency levels (Critical, High, Medium, or Low) and/or target CWEs - at least one of these must be defined for the rule to be valid
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Scope">
    Choose applicable projects (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Review and click "Create"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Existing Rules

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Edit Rule">
    1. Locate rule in table
    2. Click "Edit" button
    3. Modify settings as needed
    4. Click "Update" to save
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Toggle Status">
    1. Find rule in table
    2. Click "Toggle Status"
    3. Confirm status change
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="View Details">
    1. Click on rule name
    2. Review comprehensive information
    3. Close modal when done
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Viewing Rules on scans
    You can view blocking rules that apply to your scans in two places:

    1. On the scan details page, you'll see a "Blocking Rules" section showing all rules that were evaluated:
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/blocking_rules_scan_details.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    2. For individual issues, you can see which blocking rules were triggered in the issue details:
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/blocking_rule_issue_details.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    This makes it easy to understand which rules are affecting your scans and specific issues, helping you identify why certain changes may be blocked.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Blocking Insecure Cryptography" icon="lock">
    Create a rule targeting CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) with "Critical" urgency to prevent weak encryption usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enforcing Code Quality" icon="code">
    Set up a rule for CWE-398 (Indicator of Poor Code Quality) and CWE-477 (Use of Obsolete Functions) with "Medium" urgency to maintain code standards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
