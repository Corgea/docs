title: 'SSO'
description: 'Enable seamless and secure access to multiple applications with Single Sign-On (SSO) using the SAML protocol, enhancing user experience and security.'
---


## Overview

### Functionality
The SSO by SAML feature allows users to authenticate and access multiple applications using a single set of credentials via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol. This feature streamlines the login process, enhances security, and reduces the need for multiple passwords.

### Target Audience
This feature is designed for organizations looking to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for their users, providing a seamless and secure authentication experience across various applications.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Centralized Authentication**: Log in once to access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of password fatigue and phishing attacks by minimizing the number of passwords users need to remember.
- **Improved User Experience**: Simplifies the login process, reducing the time and effort required to access different services.

## Access Instructions

To access the SSO by SAML feature, you must provide either a SAML metadata link or specific configuration details to the Corgea support team.

## SAML Configuration Instructions

### Setting Up SAML in Your SSO Provider
1. Access your SSO provider account and set up the SAML application using these parameters:

- **Single Sign-On URL**: https://www.corgea.app/saml/acs
- **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: https://www.corgea.app/saml/metadata
- **Default RelayState**: https://www.corgea.app/projects
- **Name ID Format**: EmailAddress
- **Application Username**: Email
- **Update Application Username On**: Create and update

For the "Attribute Statement (optional)" section, use the following mappings:

- **Name** -> **Value**
  - email -> user.email
  - firstName -> user.firstName
  - lastName -> user.lastName

### Integrating SAML with Corgea

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Log into your Corgea account and head to the "Integrations" section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate SAML SSO">
    Select the "Add" option within the "SAML SSO" area.

  <Step title="SAML Configuration">
    <Card>
      <img src="/images/sso_fetch_and_populate.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} alt="SSO Modal" />
    </Card>
    - Input the SAML metadata URL in the **"Metadata URL"** field.
    - Press the **"Fetch and Populate"** button to auto-fill fields such as Entity ID, SSO URL, and X.509 Certificate using the metadata.
    - **Configuration Name**: Assign a name to your SAML configuration.
    - **Email Domain**: Define the email domain for SSO setup.

    **Manual Entry (if necessary)**:
    - Should manual input be needed, ensure you have the following details:
      - **Entity ID**: The SAML entity's unique identifier.
      - **X509 Certificate**: The certificate for signing SAML assertions.
      - **Single Sign-On Service Location**: The URL for SAML IdP authentication responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize Configuration">
    - Check the accuracy of the auto-filled fields.
    - Hit the "Connect" button to finalize and save your SAML configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Usage Guide

### Key Workflows or Actions

- **User Login**: Authenticate through the SAML IdP and get redirected back to the application with a SAML assertion. After entering your email address on the initial login page, the "Login by SAML" option will appear on the step 2 page if the setup is correct. This option is triggered by the email domain.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Login Page">
    <Card>
      <img src="/images/sso_initial_login.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} alt="Initial Login Page" />
    </Card>
    <Info>
      Enter your email address on the initial login page. If your email domain is configured for SSO, the "Login by SAML" option will appear on the next page.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login by SAML Option">
    <Card>
      <img src="/images/sso_login_by_saml.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} alt="Login by SAML Option" />
    </Card>
    <Info>
      Click on the "Login by SAML" button to proceed with authentication through your SAML Identity Provider (IdP).
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="SAML Authentication">
    <Card>
      <img src="/images/sso_saml_authentication.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} alt="SAML Authentication" />
    </Card>
    <Info>
      You will be redirected to your SAML IdP for authentication. Enter your credentials as required by your IdP.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect to Application">
    <Card>
      <img src="/images/sso_redirect_to_app.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} alt="Redirect to Application" />
    </Card>
    <Info>
      After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the application with a SAML assertion, granting you access.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Prerequisites or Dependencies

- A configured SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

## Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Certificates**: Ensure that your x509 certificates are up-to-date to maintain secure connections.
- **Test Configurations**: Before rolling out SSO to all users, test the configuration with a small group to ensure everything works as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Referer Header**: If you encounter a "Missing Referer header" error, ensure that the HTTP_ORIGIN is correctly set in the request headers.
- **No SAML Config Found**: If a configuration is not found, verify that the correct referer URL or email domain is being used.
