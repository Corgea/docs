title: 'SSO'
description: 'Enable seamless and secure access to multiple applications with Single Sign-On (SSO) using the SAML protocol, enhancing user experience and security.'
---


## Overview

### Functionality
The SSO by SAML feature allows users to authenticate and access multiple applications using a single set of credentials via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol. This feature streamlines the login process, enhances security, and reduces the need for multiple passwords.

### Target Audience
This feature is designed for organizations looking to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for their users, providing a seamless and secure authentication experience across various applications.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Centralized Authentication**: Log in once to access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of password fatigue and phishing attacks by minimizing the number of passwords users need to remember.
- **Improved User Experience**: Simplifies the login process, reducing the time and effort required to access different services.

## Access Instructions

To access the SSO by SAML feature, you must provide either a SAML metadata link or specific configuration details to the Corgea support team.

## SAML Configuration Instructions

### Setting Up SSO SAML in Your SSO Provider
1. Access your SSO provider account and set up the SAML application using these parameters:

- **Single Sign-On URL**: https://www.corgea.app/saml/acs/
- **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: https://www.corgea.app/saml/metadata/
- **Default RelayState**: https://www.corgea.app/projects/
- **Name ID Format**: EmailAddress
- **Application Username**: Email
- **Update Application Username On**: Create and update

For the "Attribute Statement (optional)" section, use the following mappings:

- **Name** -> **Value**

### Prerequisites or Dependencies

- A configured SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

## Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Certificates**: Ensure that your x509 certificates are up-to-date to maintain secure connections.
- **Test Configurations**: Before rolling out SSO to all users, test the configuration with a small group to ensure everything works as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Referer Header**: If you receive a "Missing Referer header" error, check that the HTTP_ORIGIN is correctly configured in the request headers.
- **No SAML Configuration Found**: If the configuration is missing, ensure that the correct referer URL or email domain is being utilized.
- **Permission Update**: If a user cannot access the SAML application, verify that their permissions are correctly configured and updated.
