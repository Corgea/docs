title: 'SSO'
description: 'Enable seamless and secure access to multiple applications with Single Sign-On (SSO) using the SAML protocol, enhancing user experience and security.'
---


## Overview

### Functionality
The SSO by SAML feature allows users to authenticate and access multiple applications using a single set of credentials via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol. This feature streamlines the login process, enhances security, and reduces the need for multiple passwords.

### Target Audience
This feature is designed for organizations looking to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for their users, providing a seamless and secure authentication experience across various applications.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Centralized Authentication**: Log in once to access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of password fatigue and phishing attacks by minimizing the number of passwords users need to remember.
- **Improved User Experience**: Simplifies the login process, reducing the time and effort required to access different services.

## Access Instructions

To access the SSO by SAML feature, you must provide either a SAML metadata link or specific configuration details to the Corgea support team.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Submit SAML Metadata Link or Configuration Details**: Provide either a SAML metadata link or the following configuration details to the Corgea support team:
   - **Entity ID**: The unique identifier for the SAML entity.
   - **X509 Certificate**: The certificate used for signing SAML assertions.
   - **Single Sign-On Service Location**: The URL where the SAML IdP sends authentication responses.
   - **Email Domain**: The email domain you want to configure for SSO.

## Usage Guide

### Key Workflows or Actions

- **User Login**: Authenticate through the SAML IdP and get redirected back to the application with a SAML assertion. After entering your email address on the initial login page, the "Login by SAML" option will appear on the step 2 page if the setup is correct. This option is triggered by the email domain.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect to Application">
    <Card>
      <img src="/images/sso_redirect_to_app.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} alt="Redirect to Application" />
    </Card>
    <Info>
      After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the application with a SAML assertion, granting you access.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Prerequisites or Dependencies

- A configured SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

## Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Certificates**: Ensure that your x509 certificates are up-to-date to maintain secure connections.
- **Test Configurations**: Before rolling out SSO to all users, test the configuration with a small group to ensure everything works as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Referer Header**: If you encounter a "Missing Referer header" error, ensure that the HTTP_ORIGIN is correctly set in the request headers.
- **No SAML Config Found**: If a configuration is not found, verify that the correct referer URL or email domain is being used.

# SCIM as an Optional Feature

## Overview

### Functionality
SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is an open standard designed to manage user identities in cloud-based applications and services. It automates the exchange of user identity information between identity domains or IT systems, making it easier to manage user accounts across multiple platforms.

### Target Audience
This feature is ideal for organizations that need to manage user identities across various applications efficiently.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Automated User Provisioning**: Automatically create, update, and deactivate user accounts in connected applications, reducing manual effort and errors.
- **Consistent User Data**: Ensures that user information is consistent across all integrated applications, improving data accuracy and compliance.
- **Scalability**: Easily manage a large number of users across multiple platforms, making it suitable for growing organizations.
- **Security**: Enhances security by ensuring that user access is promptly updated or revoked as needed.

## Why Customers Want SCIM

- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks, freeing up IT resources for more strategic initiatives.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces the risk of human error in user management, ensuring that user data is always up-to-date.
- **Compliance**: Helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations by ensuring that user data is consistently managed and protected.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing SSO solutions, providing a comprehensive identity management system.

## SSO SCIM Provider Configuration

To enable SCIM functionality, you need to configure the SCIM application in your SSO provider with the following settings:
- Ensure SCIM is enabled.
- Set up the Application SCIM Integration with:
  - SCIM connector base URL: https://www.corgea.app/scim/v2/
