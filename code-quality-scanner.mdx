---

The **Corgea Code Quality Scanner** is an AI-powered code review tool that identifies maintainability, readability, performance, and correctness issues in your codebase. Unlike [our security vulnerability scanners](/blast) that focus on security threats, the Code Quality Scanner acts as an expert software engineer reviewing your code to help maintain high standards and prevent technical debt.

## What It Does

The Code Quality Scanner analyzes your source code files to identify concrete issues that impact your codebase's long-term health. Think of it as having an experienced senior engineer reviewing every file, catching issues that might slip through manual code reviews while focusing on practical, actionable improvements.

### Key Capabilities

- **Automated Code Review**: Performs thorough analysis of your code, checking for common quality issues that affect maintainability
- **Language-Aware Analysis**: Understands the context and conventions of different programming languages
- **Framework Detection**: Recognizes common frameworks and applies framework-specific best practices
- **Severity Classification**: Prioritizes issues based on their impact (High, Medium, Low)
- **CWE Mapping**: Maps issues to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards for standardized categorization

---

## What It Can Find

The Code Quality Scanner identifies a comprehensive range of code quality issues. All findings are mapped to <Tooltip tip="Common Weakness Enumeration - a standardized list of software and hardware weakness types">CWE standards</Tooltip> for consistent categorization.

<AccordionGroup>

    - **Inaccurate or misleading comments** that contradict actual code behavior or may be outdated (CWE-1116)
    
    ```javascript example.js
    // Bad: Misleading comment

## How It Works

### 1. File Analysis
The scanner processes each file in your codebase individually, analyzing the complete source code with full context of the file's structure, language, and detected frameworks.

### 2. AI-Powered Review
Using advanced language models specifically trained for code review, the scanner examines your code against established software engineering principles and best practices. The AI understands:
- Language-specific idioms and conventions
- Framework patterns and best practices
- Code complexity and maintainability metrics
- Industry-standard software design principles

### 3. Issue Identification
When a potential issue is found, the scanner:
- Pinpoints the exact lines of code involved
- Classifies the issue type using CWE standards
- Assigns an appropriate severity level
- Generates a clear explanation of the problem and its impact

### 4. High-Confidence Detection
- The scanner only reports issues it's at least 90% confident about. This high threshold ensures that findings are actionable and accurate, not speculative.

- <Tip>The 90% confidence threshold significantly reduces noise and false positives, so you can trust that reported issues are worth addressing.</Tip>
---

## False Positive Suppression

The Code Quality Scanner includes sophisticated [false positive suppression](/false_positive) mechanisms to ensure you receive only meaningful, actionable findings:

### Built-In Filters

<Check>**Security Issue Exclusion**: The scanner explicitly excludes security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, etc.) as these are handled by Corgea's [dedicated security scanners](/blast). This prevents overlap and confusion between code quality and security findings.</Check>

<Check>**Style Preference Filtering**: Minor style preferences such as brace placement, indentation, and whitespace are not reported. The scanner focuses on substantive quality issues, not formatting preferences.</Check>



### Contextual Understanding

The scanner understands code context to avoid false positives:
- Recognizes when "empty" blocks are intentional (e.g., placeholder implementations)
- Understands framework-specific patterns that might otherwise look problematic
- Considers language idioms that are acceptable in specific programming languages

---

## Automated Remediation

When code quality issues are identified, Corgea provides [automated remediation capabilities](/fixes) to help you fix problems quickly and consistently:

### What Gets Remediated

The automated remediation system can fix many common code quality issues, including:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Wins">
    - Removing unused variables and imports
    - Converting magic numbers to named constants
    - Fixing typos in variable names and comments
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Structural Improvements">
    - Consolidating duplicate code into shared functions
    - Simplifying overly complex expressions
    - Breaking down complex one-liners
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    - Improving variable and function names
    - Adding proper error handling
    - Implementing framework-specific patterns
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How Remediation Works

1. **Issue Context**: The system analyzes the full context around each issue, understanding not just the problematic code but its role in the broader codebase
2. **Safe Fixes**: Automated fixes are designed to be safe and maintain existing functionality
3. **Code Style Preservation**: Fixes respect your existing code style and conventions
4. **Review Before Apply**: You maintain full control over which fixes to apply

## Separate from Vulnerability Scanning

<Warning>
The Code Quality Scanner is completely separate from Corgea's [security vulnerability scanning](/blast) capabilities.
</Warning>

### Key Differences

| Code Quality Scanner | [Vulnerability Scanner](/blast) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Focuses on maintainability, readability, and correctness | Focuses on security threats and exploitable weaknesses |
| Identifies technical debt and design issues | Identifies SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, etc. |
| Helps improve long-term code health | Helps protect against security breaches |
| Uses CWEs related to code quality | Uses CWEs related to security |

### Why Both Matter

- **Security** keeps your application safe from attackers
- **Code Quality** keeps your codebase maintainable, performant, and reliable

Both are essential for a healthy software project, but they address different concerns. A codebase can be secure but unmaintainable, or well-structured but vulnerable. Corgea provides both to give you complete visibility into your code's health.
