## Introduction

Corgea CLI is a powerful developer tool that helps you find and fix security vulnerabilities in your code. Using our AI-powered scanner (BLAST) and platform, Corgea identifies complex security issues like business logic flaws, authentication vulnerabilities, and other hard-to-find bugs. The CLI provides commands to scan your codebase, inspect findings, interact with fixes, and much more - all designed with a great developer experience in mind.

## Features

- **Multiple Scanner Support**: Scan with BLAST (our AI-powered scanner), Semgrep, or Snyk.
- **Issue Management**: List, inspect, and manage security findings.
- **Fix Integration**: View and apply AI-generated fixes for vulnerabilities right from your terminal.
- **Flexible Output**: Support for both human-readable and JSON output formats for easier CI integrations.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Fail builds based on severity levels or custom blocking rules.
- **Scan Management**: Track scan progress and results across your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Corgea CLI, ensure you have:

- **Corgea account**: An active Corgea account.
- **API Token**: A valid API token from your Corgea dashboard.

## Installation Guide

### Install with PIP

To install the Corgea CLI tool, you can use Python's package installer, pip. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install corgea-cli
```

This command fetches the Corgea CLI package from PyPI (Python Package Index) and installs it on your system. You can find more details about the package on its PyPI page: [https://pypi.org/project/corgea-cli/](https://pypi.org/project/corgea-cli/).

### Install Manually

<CodeGroup>
```bash MacOS
curl -L https://cli.corgea.app/aarch64_darwin/latest -o corgea.zip && unzip corgea.zip
chmod +x corgea
sudo mv corgea /usr/local/bin
```

```bash Windows
Download the latest binary from https://cli.corgea.app/x86_64_windows/latest

Move the executable to a directory in your PATH.
```

```bash Linux
curl -L https://cli.corgea.app/x86_64_linux/latest -o corgea.zip && unzip corgea.zip
chmod +x corgea
sudo mv corgea /usr/local/bin
```
</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

### Login with your cli

To authenticate with your API token, use the following command:

```bash
corgea login YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

### Point To A Single-Tenant Instance
 
Customers using a single-tenant instance need to have the CLI point to their instance. 

<CodeGroup>
```bash MacOS/Unix
export CORGEA_URL="https://<<Your Instance>>.corgea.app"
```

```bash Windows
$env:CORGEA_URL="https://<<Your Instance>>.corgea.app"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage
### Commands and Options

#### Upload a Scan Report

Upload a scan report to Corgea via STDIN or a file:

```bash
corgea upload path/to/report.json
```

#### Scan Your Codebase

To scan your current directory using the default BLAST scanner:

```bash
corgea scan
```

To specify a different scanner, such as Semgrep:

```bash
corgea scan semgrep
```

You can also set the CLI to fail on a specific severity level:

```bash
corgea scan --fail-on CR
```

Or fail based on blocking rules defined in the web app:

```bash
corgea scan --fail
```

#### Wait for a Scan

To wait for the latest in-progress scan:

```bash
corgea wait
```

Or specify a scan ID to wait for:

```bash
corgea wait --scan-id SCAN_ID
```

#### List Scans or Issues

To list all scans for a current directory (paginated by default):

```bash
corgea ls
```

To list issues for a specific scan:

```bash
corgea ls --issues --scan-id SCAN_ID
```

You can also control the pagination:

```bash
corgea list --page 1 --page-size 10
```

Note: The `--json` option is available for commands like `list` and `inspect` to output results in JSON format, which is useful for integrations and automation.

#### Inspect a Scan or Issue

To inspect a specific scan:

```bash
corgea inspect SCAN_ID
```

To inspect issues with detailed output:

```bash
corgea inspect --issue --json --summary ISSUE_ID
```

For fix explanations or diffs:

```bash
corgea inspect --issue --fix ISSUE_ID
corgea inspect --issue --diff ISSUE_ID
```

### Additional Options

For more options and commands, use:

```bash
corgea --help
```
