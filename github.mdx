<p>
Currently Corgea only supports GitHub repositories via the Corgea GitHub App.
This page will help you setup the GitHub App so Corgea can issue pull requests
that fix issues.

  <Step title="Start by viewing an issue">

    </Frame>
    On the issues page, find the button with the text "Install Corgea"
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    Fill out your GitHub username (not email) and the name of the organization you
    are installing. The organization name should be the one used in GitHub urls
    for your repositories (e.g. <code>https://github.com/Corgea/</code>)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue setup in Github">
    Select only one organization to install for and make sure that the organization
    you selected matches what your typed in previously. GitHub will ask you to accept
    permissions and select which repositories are accessible. Only repositories
    that are made accessible to Corgea will be capable of recieving pull requests
    from Corgea.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Back to Corgea">
    Select only one organization to install at a time and make sure that the organization
    you selected matches what you typed in previously. Once we recieve the confirmation
    from Github you will be able to issue a pull request
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/github-form.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
    Fill in the base branch you want to merge this pull request into. It needs to
    already exist.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/create-gh-pull-request.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
    When you click "Create Pull-Request" a new tab will open with pull request created.
    You may need to disable your pop-up blocker.
