## Overview
Corgea is an AI-powered platform that revolutionizes code security across multiple programming languages and their popular frameworks. It offers comprehensive support for scanning, false positive detection, and auto-fixing, covering approximately 900 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). This ensures your code remains secure, compliant, and efficient throughout your development lifecycle.

## Supported Languages and Frameworks
Here's a detailed breakdown of the languages and frameworks currently supported by Corgea:

### **C#**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea provides robust support for C# language constructs, including LINQ, async/await patterns, and generics.
- **Frameworks**: .NET, ASP.NET Core, Blazor
- Corgea excels in securing enterprise-level .NET applications, addressing vulnerabilities like improper authentication, insecure deserialization, and CSRF.

### **Python**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea analyzes Python-specific features such as decorators, context managers, and comprehensions.
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- Focuses on both web applications and backend services, tackling issues such as SQL injections, XSS, and insecure direct object references.

### **Ruby**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea understands Ruby's dynamic nature, including metaprogramming features and blocks.
- **Frameworks**: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra
- Specializes in identifying and fixing Ruby-specific vulnerabilities, including mass assignment issues, unprotected routes, and insecure file uploads.

### **Go**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea analyzes Go-specific constructs like goroutines, channels, and interfaces.
- **Frameworks**: Gin, Echo, Fiber
- Targets Go-specific security concerns, such as race conditions, improper error handling, and insecure use of cryptographic functions.

### **JavaScript & TypeScript**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, including features like async/await, closures, and TypeScript's type system.
- **Frameworks**: Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, NestJS, Angular, React, Vue.js
- Covers both client-side and server-side security, addressing issues like prototype pollution, insecure dependencies, and DOM-based XSS.

### **Java**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea analyzes Java-specific features such as generics, annotations, and lambda expressions.
- **Frameworks**: Spring, Jakarta EE, Play Framework
- Focuses on enterprise Java ecosystems, tackling vulnerabilities such as XML external entity (XXE) attacks, LDAP injection, and insecure object deserialization.

### **PHP**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea handles PHP's unique syntax and language constructs, including traits and attributes.
- Addresses common web application vulnerabilities like remote code execution, file inclusion vulnerabilities, and SQL injection attacks.

### **Kotlin**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea analyzes Kotlin-specific features including null safety, coroutines, and extension functions.
- Specializes in Android and server-side application security, addressing issues like improper data exposure and insecure communication.

### **C & C++**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea handles low-level programming constructs including pointers, memory management, and templates.
- Focuses on memory-related vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and system-level security issues common in C/C++ applications.
- Enabled for false positive detection and auto-fixing. Coming to scanning soon.

### **Swift**
- **Native Language Support**: Corgea analyzes Swift-specific features including optionals, protocol extensions, generics, and value types.
- Enhances security in iOS and macOS application development, addressing vulnerabilities like insecure data storage, improper SSL/TLS validation, and insecure inter-process communication.

## Key Features Across All Supported Languages

1. **Comprehensive Scanning**: Corgea's advanced algorithms scan your codebase to identify potential security vulnerabilities, covering a wide range of CWEs.

2. **Intelligent False Positive Detection**: Our AI-powered system accurately distinguishes between genuine vulnerabilities and false positives, saving your team valuable time and resources.

3. **Automated Fixing**: Corgea doesn't just identify issues—it provides actionable, context-aware fixes that can be applied automatically or reviewed before implementation.

4. **Framework-Specific Analysis**: Our tool understands the nuances of different frameworks within each language, providing targeted security insights.

5. **Continuous Learning**: Corgea's AI model is constantly updated to address new security threats and CWEs as they emerge.

## Intelligent File Filtering

To optimize scan performance and accuracy, Corgea automatically excludes files that are not relevant to security analysis:

### Files We Skip

**Non-Source Files**
- Media files (images, videos, fonts)
- Style files (CSS, SCSS, LESS)
- Documentation and markdown files
- Configuration archives and compressed files

**Development and Testing**
- Test files and test directories
- Mock and fixture data
- Code coverage reports

**Generated and Processed Code**
- Auto-generated code files
- Minified or bundled code
- Database migration files
- Type definition files

**Build Artifacts**
- Compiled binaries and build outputs

### Files Used for Context

While not directly scanned for vulnerabilities, Corgea may reference certain files to provide better analysis context, including README files, configuration examples, and application settings files.

## Custom Configuration

You can further customize scanning behavior using a `corgea.yaml` configuration file in your repository root:

```/dev/null/example.yaml#L1-3
ignore_paths:
  - "path/to/exclude/*"
  - "legacy-code/*"
```

This allows you to exclude specific directories or file patterns based on your project's needs.

## Why We Filter

Our intelligent filtering approach:
- **Improves accuracy** by focusing on actual application code
- **Reduces noise** from test files and third-party code
- **Optimizes performance** for faster scan results
- **Prioritizes findings** in code you maintain


## Roadmap
- Rust support
