Reporting brings together scan activity and security outcomes so you can track trends, progress, and ownership.

**Where to find reporting**
- In the app sidebar, open `Reporting` to access:
- `General` for security and developer insights
- `Scans` for scan operations and PR policy status
- `Aging` for vulnerability aging and overdue trend analysis (available when policies are enabled)

**General reporting tabs**
- `Code Vulnerabilities` shows unique vulnerability counts, category coverage, false positives, remediation progress, MTTR, and burn-down trends.
- `Code Quality` highlights open vs fixed issues, severity distribution, categories, languages, and top projects.
- `SCA` summarizes dependency vulnerabilities by severity, ecosystem, package, and direct vs transitive impact.
- `IaC` breaks down infrastructure findings by severity, provider, service, rule, and IaC type.
- `Developer Insights` combines developer feedback and Corgea Agent usage trends, decisions, and active users.

**Filters and time controls**
- Use the project and tag filters to scope all charts to a single project or set of tags.
- For time-series charts, choose a date range and group by day, week, or month.
- Severity filters on supported charts let you focus on critical, high, medium, or low issues.

**Scans reporting**
- `Scans` focuses on operational visibility, including PR policy status, repositories covered, full scans, PR scans, and scan performance over time.

**Aging report**
- The aging report highlights overdue issues, average age, and where risk is accumulating by project and assignee.
