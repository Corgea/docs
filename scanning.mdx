## Scanning your repository

To upload vulnerability data and code to Corgea using the Corgea CLI, you first need to generate a report from your existing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanner, such as Snyk or Semgrep. Once you have the report, you can use the corgea upload command followed by the path to the report file. The CLI will then upload the vulnerability data and the affected code snippets to Corgea for analysis and fixing. Here's a brief example:



<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You registered in Corgea

  **SAST Scanner** You have a SAST scanner like Snyk, Semgrep, etc.
</Info>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to repository">
    Go to the repository you want to scan:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  cd <<Respository Name>>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the scan">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Semgrep
    corgea scan semgrep
    ```

    ```bash Snyk
    corgea scan snyk
    ```

    ```bash Checkmarx
    # Create a scan with a JSON output for example:
    cx scan create --project-name juice-shop -s . --branch master --scan-types sast --report-format json --output-name report

    #Upload the vulnerability report to Corgea
    corgea upload report.json
    ```

    ```bash CodeQL
    corgea upload <scan report in sarif json>
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="See Results">
    Once a scan is completed a scan report will be generated in the repository folder and a copy will be sent to Corgea for processing.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Issue Fixes">
  Depending on the size of the results in the scan, it may take sometime for results to show up. For a couple of hundred findings, it should take 10 mins.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Not Found">
  This error happens because you haven't installed the Corega CLI or its not available in your PATH.
  ```
  bash: corgea: command not found
  ```
  Follow the instructions in the [install CLI section](http://localhost:3001/install_cli) to install the CLI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid token provided.">
    Double check you have logged into the CLI with the correct token from [https://www.corgea.app/integrations/](https://www.corgea.app/integrations/)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not Logged In">
    You might receive an error that you're not logged into your SAST/SCA tool. 

    Some tools require you to login to use the tool. For example, you can login to Semgrep with the following command:
    ```
      semgrep login
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Git Show Failed to Run">
    You might receive an error that you're not logged into your SAST/SCA tool. 

    Some tools require you to login to use the tool. For example, you can login to Semgrep with the following command:
    ```
      Command failed with output:
      fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


      Failed to run 'git show -s --format=%B'. Possible reasons:

      - the git binary is not available
      - the current working directory is not a git repository
      - the current working directory is not marked as safe
          (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

      Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
      Could not start scan Command failed with exit code: 128
