<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to repository">
    Go to the repository you want to scan:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  cd <<Respository Name>>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Command">
    Go to the [integrations](https://corgea.app/integrations) page in Corgea to obtain the correct command for your scanner.

    The command you copy will have all the needed functions and your API key.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Semgrep
    export CORGEA_TOKEN=<API_KEY>; curl -sSL https://cli.corgea.app | bash -s semgrep ci --json
    ```

    ```bash Snyk
    export CORGEA_TOKEN=<API_KEY>; curl -sSL https://cli.corgea.app | bash -s snyk code test --json
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Command">
    Once a scan is completed a scan report will be generated in the repository folder and a copy will be sent to Corgea for processing.
