## Scanning your repository

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You registered in Corgea
</Info>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to repository">
    Go to the repository you want to scan:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  cd <<Respository Name>>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Command">
    Go to the [integrations](https://corgea.app/integrations) page in Corgea to obtain the correct command for your scanner.

    The command you copy will have all the needed functions and your API key.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Semgrep
    export CORGEA_TOKEN=<API_KEY>; curl -sSL https://cli.corgea.app | bash -s semgrep ci --json
    ```

    ```bash Snyk
    export CORGEA_TOKEN=<API_KEY>; curl -sSL https://cli.corgea.app | bash -s snyk code test --json
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Command">
    Once a scan is completed a scan report will be generated in the repository folder and a copy will be sent to Corgea for processing.

  <Step title="Issue Fixes">
  Depending on the size of the results in the scan, it may take sometime for results to show up. For a couple of hundred findings, it should take 10 mins. 

  Go to [fixes](fixes) to learn more.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Not Found">
  This error happens because you either don't have Snyk or Semgrep installed. 
  ```
  zsh: command not found: snyk
  ```
  You should install the appropriate scanner that you're using. 
  - [Semgrep Installation](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/)
  - [Snyk Installation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli)
