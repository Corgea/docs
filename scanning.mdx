## Scanning your repository

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You registered in Corgea
</Info>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to repository">
    Go to the repository you want to scan:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  cd <<Respository Name>>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Command">
    Go to the [integrations](https://corgea.app/integrations) page in Corgea to obtain the correct command for your scanner.

    The command you copy will have all the needed functions and your API key. 

    In brief, this command will run your scanner, and send the vulnerabilities report to Corgea for analysis. If you'd like to see the contents of the command, you can do so [here](https://github.com/Corgea/cli/blob/main/cli.sh).

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Semgrep
    export CORGEA_TOKEN=<API_KEY>; curl -sSL https://cli.corgea.app | bash -s semgrep ci --json
    ```

    ```bash Snyk
    export CORGEA_TOKEN=<API_KEY>; curl -sSL https://cli.corgea.app | bash -s snyk code test --json
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Command">
    Once a scan is completed a scan report will be generated in the repository folder and a copy will be sent to Corgea for processing.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Issue Fixes">
  Depending on the size of the results in the scan, it may take sometime for results to show up. For a couple of hundred findings, it should take 10 mins. 

  Go to [fixes](fixes) to learn more.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Not Found">
  This error happens because you either don't have Snyk or Semgrep installed. 
  ```
  zsh: command not found: snyk
  ```
  You should install the appropriate scanner that you're using. 
  - [Semgrep Installation](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/)
  - [Snyk Installation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid command provided. Supported SAST tools are snyk and semgrep currently">
    Please make sure you've copied the full command as found in Corgea, and do not modify it. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CORGEA_TOKEN is not set">
    This happens when you try to execute the Corgea CLI command, but the CORGEA_TOKEN is missing from the command. Please get the full command from [here](https://www.corgea.app/integrations/). 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not Logged In">
    You might receive an error that you're not logged into your SAST/SCA tool. 

    Some tools require you to login to use the tool. For example, you can login to Semgrep with the following command:
    ```
      semgrep login
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Git Show Failed to Run">
    You might receive an error that you're not logged into your SAST/SCA tool. 

    Some tools require you to login to use the tool. For example, you can login to Semgrep with the following command:
    ```
      Command failed with output:
      fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


      Failed to run 'git show -s --format=%B'. Possible reasons:

      - the git binary is not available
      - the current working directory is not a git repository
      - the current working directory is not marked as safe
          (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

      Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
      Could not start scan Command failed with exit code: 128
