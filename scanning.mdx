    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Git Show Failed to Run">
    You might receive an error that you're not logged into your SAST/SCA tool. 

    Some tools require you to login to use the tool. For example, you can login to Semgrep with the following command:
    ```
      Command failed with output:
      fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


      Failed to run 'git show -s --format=%B'. Possible reasons:

      - the git binary is not available
      - the current working directory is not a git repository
      - the current working directory is not marked as safe
          (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

      Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
