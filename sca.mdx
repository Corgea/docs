title: 'Dependency Scanning (SCA)'
description: "Dependency Scanning, also known as Software Composition Analysis (SCA), automatically identifies known security vulnerabilities in your project's third-party dependencies and libraries. It scans dependency manifest files (like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`) and provides detailed vulnerability information including CVE identifiers, CVSS scores, and remediation guidance."

## Overview

* **What it Does**: Dependency Scanning, also known as Software Composition Analysis (SCA), automatically identifies known security vulnerabilities in your project's third-party dependencies and libraries. It scans dependency manifest files (like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`) and provides detailed vulnerability information including CVE identifiers, CVSS scores, and remediation guidance.

* **Who it's For**: This feature is designed for security teams, developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone responsible for maintaining secure software applications. It's particularly valuable for teams managing projects with numerous third-party dependencies who need to stay informed about security vulnerabilities that could impact their applications.

## Key Features and Benefits

* **Comprehensive Ecosystem Coverage**: Scans dependencies across 25+ programming languages and ecosystems including Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP, C#, Swift, and many more

## Usage Guide

### Key Workflows

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically identifies dependency files in your project directory
2. **Comprehensive Scanning**: Analyzes all supported dependency files and cross-references against vulnerability databases
3. **Vulnerability Processing**: Processes scan results and enriches with additional security intelligence
4. **Issue Creation**: Creates trackable security issues for each vulnerability found
5. **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports with actionable remediation guidance

### Reachability & Usage Analysis (AI-native SCA)

When AI-native SCA is enabled, Corgea adds reachability and usage signals for **direct dependencies** to help you focus on issues that are truly exploitable in your codebase.

**Reachability statuses**:
- **Reachable**: A vulnerable code path is reachable from your application code
- **Unreachable**: The dependency is used, but no vulnerable call path is reachable
- **Unused**: The dependency is declared but not referenced in your codebase
- **Analyzing**: Reachability analysis is queued or in progress

**Where to find it**:
- In scan results, use the **Reachability** filter to narrow findings by status
- Use **Dependency depth** to filter **Direct** vs **Transitive** dependencies
- In an SCA issue, the Reachability tab summarizes usage and, when available, shows per-file usage context

### Vulnerability Severity Breakdown

<Warning>**Critical**: Immediate action required, potential for complete system compromise</Warning>

- **High**: Should be addressed promptly, significant security impact
- **Medium**: Should be addressed in regular maintenance cycles
- **Low**: Minor issues that can be addressed when convenient

## Container & Image Scanning

Container scanning identifies security vulnerabilities in Docker images used in your project. This includes vulnerabilities in base operating system packages, system libraries, and any software installed within the container image layers. By scanning container images, you can identify security risks before deploying containerized applications to production.

Corgea automatically discovers container images in your project by scanning for Dockerfiles and docker-compose configuration files. The scanner extracts all image references (such as `FROM python:3.11-slim` in Dockerfiles or `image: postgres:15` in docker-compose files) and analyzes them for known vulnerabilities.

**Supported Registries**:
- Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), Google Container Registry (GCR), Quay.io, Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), Amazon ECR Public, GitLab Container Registry

<Info>Container scanning is automatically enabled when Docker files are detected in your project. No configuration needed.</Info>

**Limitations**:
- Only public registry images are scanned
- Maximum image size: 200MB
- Private registry images are skipped

### Container Security Best Practices

<Tip>Use specific image tags (e.g., `python:3.11.5-slim`) instead of `latest` for consistent scan results.</Tip>

* **Use Specific Tags**: Avoid `latest` tags; pin exact versions for reproducible scans
* **Prefer Minimal Base Images**: Use slim, alpine, or distroless variants to reduce attack surface
* **Regular Updates**: Keep base images updated to receive security patches
* **Multi-Stage Builds**: Minimize final image size and included packages

## Best Practices

<Tip>Enable automatic scanning to catch new vulnerabilities as they are disclosed in real-time.</Tip>

* **Regular Scanning**: Enable automatic scanning to catch new vulnerabilities as they are disclosed
* **Dependency Updates**: Promptly update dependencies when fixes are available for identified vulnerabilities
* **Severity Prioritization**: Focus on addressing Critical and High severity vulnerabilities first
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate whether vulnerabilities actually affect your application's attack surface
* **Dependency Hygiene**: Regularly review and remove unused dependencies to reduce attack surface
* **Version Pinning**: Use specific version numbers in dependency files for consistent scanning results
* **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities discovered in your dependencies
* **Documentation**: Maintain records of accepted risks and remediation decisions

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No vulnerabilities found but dependencies are present">
    **Solution**: Verify that dependency files are in supported formats and contain valid package information

    **Check**: Ensure dependency files are not corrupted or contain syntax errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scan results seem incomplete">
    **Solution**: Check that all dependency files are included in the scan scope

    **Check**: Verify that dependency files are properly formatted and accessible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="False positive vulnerabilities reported">
    **Solution**: Review vulnerability details to determine if they actually affect your application

    **Check**: Consider the specific usage patterns and attack vectors in your application
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scan performance is slow">
    **Solution**: This is normal for large projects with many dependencies
