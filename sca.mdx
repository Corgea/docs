title: 'Dependency Scanning (SCA)'
description: "Dependency Scanning, also known as Software Composition Analysis (SCA), automatically identifies known security vulnerabilities in your project's third-party dependencies and libraries. It scans dependency manifest files (like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`) and provides detailed vulnerability information including CVE identifiers, CVSS scores, and remediation guidance."

## Overview

* **What it Does**: Dependency Scanning, also known as Software Composition Analysis (SCA), automatically identifies known security vulnerabilities in your project's third-party dependencies and libraries. It scans dependency manifest files (like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`) and provides detailed vulnerability information including CVE identifiers, CVSS scores, and remediation guidance.

* **Who it's For**: This feature is designed for security teams, developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone responsible for maintaining secure software applications. It's particularly valuable for teams managing projects with numerous third-party dependencies who need to stay informed about security vulnerabilities that could impact their applications.

## Key Features and Benefits

* **Comprehensive Ecosystem Coverage**: Scans dependencies across 25+ programming languages and ecosystems including Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP, C#, Swift, and many more
* **Authoritative Data Sources**: Leverages multiple trusted vulnerability databases including:
  - GitHub Advisory Database (CC-BY 4.0)
  - PyPI Advisory Database (CC-BY 4.0)
  - Go Vulnerability Database (CC-BY 4.0)
  - Rust Advisory Database (CC0 1.0)
  - Global Security Database (CC0 1.0)
  - OSS-Fuzz (CC-BY 4.0)

  - And many more authoritative sources
* **Rich Vulnerability Intelligence**: Provides detailed vulnerability information including:
  - CVE identifiers and alternative vulnerability IDs
  - CVSS scores and severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Affected package versions and available fixes
  - Detailed vulnerability descriptions and references
  - Publication dates and external links
* **Smart Scanning Logic**: Automatically detects when dependency files are present and optimizes scanning performance

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Project must contain at least one supported dependency file
- Appropriate permissions to run security scans
- Access to the scanning service

### Configuration Steps

1. **Access Scanning Configuration**: Navigate to your project's security scanning settings
2. **Enable SCA Scanning**: Toggle the dependency scanning option to "enabled"
3. **Verify Dependency Files**: Ensure your project contains supported dependency files:
   ```
   # Python
   requirements.txt, Pipfile, Pipfile.lock, pyproject.toml, poetry.lock
   
   # JavaScript/Node.js
   package.json, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml
   
   # Java
   pom.xml, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts, gradle.lockfile
   
   # Go
   go.mod, go.sum
   
   # Ruby
   Gemfile, Gemfile.lock
   
   # PHP
   composer.json, composer.lock
   
   # C#
   *.csproj, packages.config
   
   # Swift
   Package.swift, Package.resolved
   ```

4. **Configure Scan Scope**: Choose whether to include dependency scanning in full or partial scans
5. **Set Up Notifications**: Configure how you want to be notified of new vulnerabilities

## Usage Guide

### Key Workflows

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically identifies dependency files in your project directory
2. **Comprehensive Scanning**: Analyzes all supported dependency files and cross-references against vulnerability databases
3. **Vulnerability Processing**: Processes scan results and enriches with additional security intelligence
4. **Issue Creation**: Creates trackable security issues for each vulnerability found
5. **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports with actionable remediation guidance

### Vulnerability Severity Breakdown
- **Critical**: Immediate action required, potential for complete system compromise
- **High**: Should be addressed promptly, significant security impact
- **Medium**: Should be addressed in regular maintenance cycles
- **Low**: Minor issues that can be addressed when convenient

## Best Practices

* **Regular Scanning**: Enable automatic scanning to catch new vulnerabilities as they are disclosed
* **Dependency Updates**: Promptly update dependencies when fixes are available for identified vulnerabilities
* **Severity Prioritization**: Focus on addressing Critical and High severity vulnerabilities first
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate whether vulnerabilities actually affect your application's attack surface
* **Dependency Hygiene**: Regularly review and remove unused dependencies to reduce attack surface
* **Version Pinning**: Use specific version numbers in dependency files for consistent scanning results
* **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities discovered in your dependencies
* **Documentation**: Maintain records of accepted risks and remediation decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: No vulnerabilities found but dependencies are present
* **Solution**: Verify that dependency files are in supported formats and contain valid package information
* **Check**: Ensure dependency files are not corrupted or contain syntax errors

**Issue**: Scan results seem incomplete
* **Solution**: Check that all dependency files are included in the scan scope
* **Check**: Verify that dependency files are properly formatted and accessible

**Issue**: False positive vulnerabilities reported
* **Solution**: Review vulnerability details to determine if they actually affect your application
* **Check**: Consider the specific usage patterns and attack vectors in your application

**Issue**: Scan performance is slow
* **Solution**: This is normal for large projects with many dependencies
* **Check**: Consider using incremental scanning for changed files only
