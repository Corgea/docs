## What are Role-Based Permissions?

Role-based permissions (also known as Role-Based Access Control or RBAC) is a security model that restricts system access based on a user's role within an organization. Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, permissions are assigned to roles, and users are then assigned to appropriate roles based on their job functions.

### Key Benefits

- **Simplified Management**: Assign permissions once to a role, then add users to that role rather than managing permissions for each individual user
- **Consistency**: Ensures all users with the same role have identical access rights
- **Scalability**: Easy to onboard new team members by assigning them to pre-configured roles
- **Security**: Follows the principle of least privilege by granting only the permissions necessary for each role
- **Audit & Compliance**: Simplifies access reviews and compliance reporting by organizing permissions around job functions

### How It Works in Corgea

In Corgea, you create **Permission Groups** that correspond to different roles in your organization (e.g., Admin, Developer, Security Manager). Each Permission Group is assigned a specific set of permissions that define what actions users in that role can perform. Users are then added to one or more Permission Groups, inheriting all permissions from those groups.

<Note>
Permissions are **additive** - if a user belongs to multiple Permission Groups, they receive all permissions from all groups they are a member of.
</Note>

## Role-Based Permission Recommendations

Based on the permissions defined in the Corgea platform, here's a recommended permission matrix for different roles.

### Permission Groups Overview

The following are suggested Permission Groups to setup. Corgea comes with the Admin permission out of the box.
