## Overview

Corgea provides multiple export options for your security findings, allowing you to integrate with various tools and workflows. You can export scan results in industry-standard formats for further analysis, reporting, or integration with other security tools.

## Export Formats

### SARIF Export

SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) is an industry-standard format for representing the output of static analysis tools. Corgea supports exporting scan results in SARIF 2.1.0 format, making it easy to integrate with various security tools and CI/CD pipelines.

#### How to Export to SARIF

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Scan Results">
    Go to your project's scan results page where you can see all detected security issues.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select SARIF Format">
    Choose the SARIF export option to download your security findings in SARIF format.
  </Step>

#### SARIF Report Structure

The exported SARIF report follows the SARIF 2.1.0 specification and includes:

- **Tool Information**: Details about Corgea as the scanning tool
- **Rules**: Definitions of security vulnerabilities detected, including CWE classifications
- **Results**: Individual security findings with locations and metadata

Each security rule in the SARIF report includes:

```json
{
  "id": "CWE-89",
  "name": "SQL Injection",
  "shortDescription": {
    "text": "SQL Injection"
  },
  "fullDescription": {
    "text": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
  },
  "defaultConfiguration": {
    "level": "warning"
  }
}
```

#### Sample SARIF Report

You can view a complete sample SARIF report here: [Sample SARIF Report](/samples/corgea_a45fca2d-3684-4586-951e-d8181e78df19.sarif)

The sample report demonstrates how Corgea exports various security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79) 
- Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- Missing Authorization (CWE-862)
- And many other common security vulnerabilities

### CSV Export

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format provides a simple, spreadsheet-compatible export option for your security findings. This format is ideal for:

- Creating custom reports and dashboards
- Importing into business intelligence tools
- Sharing findings with stakeholders who prefer tabular data
- Performing bulk analysis in spreadsheet applications

The CSV export includes key information about each security finding such as:
- Issue ID and Scan ID for tracking
- Project name and classification details
- Vulnerability type (CWE classification) and urgency level
- File location, line number, and programming language
- Issue description and severity ratings

#### Sample CSV Report

You can view a complete sample CSV report here: [Sample CSV Report](/samples/corgea_a45fca2d-3684-4586-951e-d8181e78df19.csv)

The CSV format includes these columns:
- **Issue ID**: Unique identifier for each security finding
- **Scan ID**: Identifier linking findings to specific scan runs
- **Project Name**: Name of the scanned project
- **Classification ID**: CWE identifier (e.g., CWE-89 for SQL Injection)
- **Issue Classification**: Human-readable vulnerability name
- **Urgency**: Priority level (CR=Critical, HI=High, ME=Medium)
- **File**: Path to the affected source code file
- **Line Number**: Specific line where the issue was detected
- **Language**: Programming language of the affected file

### PDF Export (Coming Soon)

PDF export functionality is currently in development and will be available soon. This feature will provide:
- Professional, formatted reports suitable for executive summaries
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions and remediation guidance
- Charts and visualizations of security findings
- Customizable report templates

## Integration Benefits

### SARIF Integration Advantages

- **Tool Compatibility**: SARIF files can be consumed by various security tools, IDEs, and CI/CD systems
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub natively supports SARIF for security alerts and code scanning
- **Standardized Format**: Industry-standard format ensures compatibility across different platforms
- **Rich Metadata**: Includes detailed location information, severity levels, and remediation guidance

### Use Cases

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automatically process SARIF reports in your build pipeline
- **Security Dashboard Integration**: Import findings into centralized security management platforms
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate standardized reports for security audits and compliance requirements
- **Developer Workflow**: Integrate with IDEs that support SARIF for inline security feedback

## Best Practices

- **Regular Exports**: Set up regular exports to track security improvements over time
- **Version Control**: Store exported reports alongside your code for historical tracking
- **Automated Processing**: Use SARIF exports in automated workflows for continuous security monitoring
- **Tool Integration**: Leverage SARIF compatibility to integrate with your existing security toolchain

## Technical Specifications

### SARIF Version
Corgea exports use SARIF version 2.1.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest tools and platforms.

### File Size Considerations
Large projects may generate substantial SARIF files. Consider filtering results or exporting specific vulnerability types for very large codebases.

### Schema Validation
All exported SARIF files conform to the official SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema, ensuring reliable parsing by compatible tools.
