## Overview

AI-native SAST is Corgea's next-generation code scanning solution, designed to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in application code, with a particular emphasis on business logic, authentication and code flaws. Unlike traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, AI-native SAST uses advanced AI-driven techniques to enhance detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and provide actionable insights for developers and security teams.

By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with static analysis, AI-native SAST delivers a deeper contextual understanding of code, allowing it to detect vulnerabilities that standard SAST tools might miss. This document provides a technical overview of how AI-native SAST works, what it can detect, and how it integrates into development workflows.

## Intelligent File Filtering

To optimize scan performance and accuracy, Corgea automatically excludes files that are not relevant to security analysis:

### Files We Skip

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-Source Files" icon="file-image">
    - Media files (images, videos, fonts)
    - Style files (CSS, SCSS, LESS)
    - Documentation and markdown files
    - Configuration archives and compressed files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Development and Testing" icon="flask">
    - Test files and test directories
    - Mock and fixture data
    - Code coverage reports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated and Processed Code" icon="gears">
    - Auto-generated code files
    - Minified or bundled code
    - Database migration files
    - Type definition files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build Artifacts" icon="box">
    - Compiled binaries and build outputs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Files Used for Context

While not directly scanned for vulnerabilities, Corgea may reference certain files to provide better analysis context, including README files, configuration examples, and application settings files.

### Custom Configuration

You can further customize scanning behavior using a `corgea.yaml` configuration file in your repository root:

```docs/corgea.yaml#L1-3
ignore_paths:
  - "path/to/exclude/*"
  - "legacy-code/*"
```

This allows you to exclude specific directories or file patterns based on your project's needs.

### Why We Filter

Our intelligent filtering approach:
- **Improves accuracy** by focusing on actual application code
- **Reduces noise** from test files and third-party code
- **Optimizes performance** for faster scan results
- **Prioritizes findings** in code you maintain

<Note>
**Coming Soon**: Rust language support
