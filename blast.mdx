## Overview

BLAST (Business Logic Application Security Testing) is Corgea's next-generation code scanning solution, designed to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in application code, with a particular emphasis on business logic, authentication and code flaws. Unlike traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, BLAST uses advanced AI-driven techniques to enhance detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and provide actionable insights for developers and security teams.

By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with static analysis, BLAST delivers a deeper contextual understanding of code, allowing it to detect vulnerabilities that standard SAST tools might miss. This document provides a technical overview of how BLAST works, what it can detect, and how it integrates into development workflows.

<Note>BLAST is currently in **private beta** and is **not enabled by default**. If you're interested in participating in the beta, please reach out to our support team for more details.</Note>

## Key Features

- **AI-Enhanced Code Analysis**: Combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with static code analysis to accurately detect vulnerabilities.
- **Business Logic and Traditional SAST Vulnerability Detection**: In addition to detecting business logic flaws, BLAST is fully capable of identifying the standard SAST vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, and insecure data handling).
- **Low False Positive Rate**: Reduces the noise associated with traditional code scanning by focusing on real issues.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides clear explanations for detected vulnerabilities, improving developer understanding and efficiency in fixing issues.
- **Seamless Workflow Integration**: Designed to integrate into existing CI/CD pipelines and pull request workflows.
- **Comprehensive Secret Scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets, credentials, and sensitive information across your entire codebase.

## Vulnerability Classes Detected

BLAST excels at detecting business logic vulnerabilities, which are often missed by traditional SAST tools. Below are some of the specific vulnerabilities detected by BLAST:

- **Insecure Data Storage (CWE-311)**: Storing sensitive data insecurely, such as in plaintext or using weak encryption.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200)**: Accidental exposure of sensitive information through logs, error messages, or improper storage.
- **Improper Error Handling (CWE-209)**: Leaking information through error messages or causing unintended behavior due to poor error management.
- **Improper Logging (CWE-532)**: Logging sensitive data or failing to log important security events.
- **Improper Exception Handling (CWE-248)**: Failing to handle exceptions securely, leading to potential crashes, data loss, or security risks.
- **Hardcoded Secrets (CWE-798)**: Detection of embedded credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information in source code.
- **Malicious Code (CWE-506)**: Intentionally harmful code that performs unauthorized or malicious actions like file deletion, unauthorized encryption, or data theft.
- **Backdoors (CWE-288)**: Hidden access mechanisms that bypass normal security controls through undocumented endpoints or covert channels.
- **Data Exfiltration (CWE-319)**: Unauthorized collection and transmission of sensitive data outside the system.
- **Unethical Data Collection (CWE-359)**: Collection of user data without proper consent or beyond legitimate application needs.
- **Malicious Network Communication (CWE-293)**: Suspicious or unauthorized outbound network connections and data transfers.
- **Time Bombs or Logic Bombs (CWE-511)**: Code designed to trigger malicious actions based on specific conditions or timing.
- **Obfuscation Techniques (CWE-116)**: Unnecessarily complex or obscured code potentially hiding malicious functionality.
- **Unauthorized Cryptocurrency Mining (CWE-400)**: Unauthorized use of system resources for cryptocurrency mining operations.

In addition to business logic vulnerabilities, BLAST can also detect common security flaws found in regular SAST scanning. 

## Secret Scanning Capabilities

BLAST includes comprehensive secret scanning functionality to identify exposed sensitive information across your codebase. The scanner detects various types of secrets, including:

- API keys and tokens (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.)
- Authentication credentials (usernames, passwords)
- Database connection strings
- Private keys and certificates
- OAuth tokens
- Personal access tokens (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Encryption keys
- Environment variables containing sensitive data
- Internal service endpoints and URLs
- Payment processing credentials

The secret scanner uses pattern matching, entropy analysis, and AI-powered contextual understanding to minimize false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage. When secrets are detected, BLAST provides detailed information about:

- The type of secret detected
- Its location in the codebase
- The potential security impact
- Recommendations for secure storage alternatives (e.g., using environment variables or secret management services)

## Technology Behind BLAST

BLAST is powered by Corgea's proprietary CodeIQ technology, which combines AI with Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Project-Level Analysis**: BLAST parses the entire project to build a complete picture of how code components interact. This ensures that vulnerabilities arising from complex code relationships are not missed.
- **Contextual Intelligence**: The AI engine understands the broader context of the code, including how different components—such as middleware, configurations, and templates—contribute to potential vulnerabilities.
- **False Positive Reduction**: By understanding the code context and logic, BLAST reduces the rate of false positives that plague traditional SAST tools.

### Comparison to Traditional Methods

Traditional static analysis techniques like source-sink analysis and call-graphs have significant limitations:

- **Source-Sink Analysis**: Tends to miss validation steps and context-specific vulnerabilities, often leading to false positives.
- **Call-Graphs**: Miss critical runtime behaviors like reflection or dynamic dependency injection, making it harder to detect certain vulnerabilities.
- **Vector Search and RAG**: These newer methods suffer from overgeneralization, retrieving irrelevant data such as migration files or tests that do not contribute to the security context.

In contrast, BLAST's AI-driven approach ensures comprehensive coverage without introducing irrelevant noise into the analysis.

## Integration and Workflow

BLAST integrates seamlessly into existing development environments and workflows. Key integration points include:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: BLAST can be integrated into your continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to scan code automatically at each commit or pull request.
- **Pull Request Reviews**: BLAST analyzes each pull request for potential vulnerabilities, providing actionable insights before code is merged into the main branch.
- **IDE Integration**: Developers can run BLAST directly within their integrated development environment (IDE), receiving real-time feedback on potential vulnerabilities as they write code.

### Supported Languages and Frameworks

BLAST supports a wide range of languages and their associated frameworks, ensuring broad applicability across various application stacks:

- **Languages**: C#, Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
- **Frameworks**: .NET, Django, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Spring, Flask, and more

## Conclusion

BLAST is a next-generation application security tool that provides deep insights into business logic vulnerabilities, as well as traditional SAST vulnerabilities, offering more accurate detection and fewer false positives than conventional tools. By integrating AI and static analysis, BLAST helps development and security teams focus on real issues, making the development process more secure and efficient.
