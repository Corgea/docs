title: "CWE-1070: Serializable Data Element Containing non-Serializable Item Elements"
---

## Description
The product contains a serializable, storable data element such as a field or member,
					but the data element contains member elements that are not
					serializable.

## Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.
As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java.
