title: "CWE-595: Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents"
---

## Description
The product compares object references instead of the contents of the objects themselves, preventing it from detecting equivalent objects.

## Extended Description
For example, in Java, comparing objects using == usually produces deceptive results, since the == operator compares object references rather than values; often, this means that using == for strings is actually comparing the strings' references, not their values.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
