---

## Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

## Extended Description
Typically, this can result in corruption of data, a crash, or code execution.  The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer.  A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None
