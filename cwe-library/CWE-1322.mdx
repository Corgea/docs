title: "CWE-1322: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context"
---

## Description
The product uses a non-blocking model that relies on a single threaded process
			for features such as scalability, but it contains code that can block when it is invoked.

## Extended Description

When an attacker can directly invoke the blocking code, or the blocking code can be affected by environmental conditions that can be influenced by an attacker, then this can lead to a denial of service by causing unexpected hang or freeze of the code. Examples of blocking code might be an expensive computation or calling
				blocking library calls, such as those that perform exclusive file operations or require a successful network operation.
Due to limitations in multi-thread models, single-threaded
				models are used to overcome the resource constraints that are caused by using
				many threads. In such a model, all code should generally be
				non-blocking. If blocking code is called, then the event loop will
				effectively be stopped, which can be undesirable or dangerous.  Such
				models are used in Python asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js, or other
				custom event loop code.
