title: "CWE-1310: Missing Ability to Patch ROM Code"
---

## Description
Missing an ability to patch ROM code may leave a System or System-on-Chip (SoC) in a vulnerable state.

## Extended Description

A System or System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements a boot process utilizing security mechanisms such as Root-of-Trust (RoT) typically starts by executing code from a Read-only-Memory (ROM) component. The code in ROM is immutable, hence any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for the systems that are already in use.
A common weakness is that the ROM does not have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the system gets shipped.  This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary can compromise the SoC.
