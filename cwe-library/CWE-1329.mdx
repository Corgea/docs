title: "CWE-1329: Reliance on Component That is Not Updateable"
---

## Description
The product contains a component that cannot be updated or patched in order to remove vulnerabilities or significant bugs.

## Extended Description


			  If the component is discovered to contain a vulnerability or critical bug, but the issue cannot be fixed using an update or patch, then the product's owner will not be able to protect against the issue.  The only option might be replacement of the product, which could be too financially or operationally expensive for the product owner.  As a result, the inability to patch or update can leave the product open to attacker exploitation or critical operation failures. This weakness can be especially difficult to manage when using ROM, firmware, or similar components that traditionally have had limited or no update capabilities.
			  

			    In industries such as healthcare, "legacy"
			    devices can be operated for decades.  As a
			    US task force report [REF-1197] notes, "the inability
			    to update or replace equipment has both
			    large and small health care delivery
			    organizations struggle with numerous
			    unsupported legacy systems that cannot
			    easily be replaced (hardware, software, and
			    operating systems) with large numbers of
			    vulnerabilities and few modern
			    countermeasures."
			    

			    While hardware can be prone to this weakness, software systems can also be affected, such as when a third-party driver or library is no longer actively maintained or supported but is still critical for the required functionality.
