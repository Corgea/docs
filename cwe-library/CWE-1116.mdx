## Description
The source code contains comments that do not accurately
					describe or explain aspects of the portion of the code with which the comment is
					associated.

## Extended Description
When a comment does not accurately reflect the associated code elements, this can introduce confusion to a reviewer (due to inconsistencies) or make it more difficult and less efficient to validate that the code is implementing the intended behavior correctly.
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.  It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Likelihood of Exploit
