title: "CWE-1190: DMA Device Enabled Too Early in Boot Phase"
---

## Description
The product enables a Direct Memory Access (DMA) capable device before the security configuration settings are established, which allows an attacker to extract data from or gain privileges on the product.

## Extended Description

DMA is included in a number of devices because it allows
              data transfer between the computer and the connected device, using
              direct hardware access to read or write directly to main memory
              without any OS interaction. An attacker could exploit this to
              access secrets. Several virtualization-based mitigations have been introduced to thwart DMA attacks. These are usually
              configured/setup during boot time. However, certain IPs that are
              powered up before boot is complete (known as early boot IPs) may
              be DMA capable. Such IPs, if not trusted, could launch DMA
              attacks and gain access to assets that should otherwise be
              protected.
