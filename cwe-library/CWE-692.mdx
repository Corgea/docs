title: "CWE-692: Incomplete Denylist to Cross-Site Scripting"
---

## Description
The product uses a denylist-based protection mechanism to defend against XSS attacks, but the denylist is incomplete, allowing XSS variants to succeed.

## Extended Description
While XSS might seem simple to prevent, web browsers vary so widely in how they parse web pages, that a denylist cannot keep track of all the variations. The "XSS Cheat Sheet" [REF-714] contains a large number of attacks that are intended to bypass incomplete denylists.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
