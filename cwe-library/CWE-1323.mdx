title: "CWE-1323: Improper Management of Sensitive Trace Data"
---

## Description
Trace data collected from several sources on the
                System-on-Chip (SoC) is stored in unprotected locations or
                transported to untrusted agents.

## Extended Description

To facilitate verification of complex System-on-Chip
                    (SoC) designs, SoC integrators add specific IP blocks that
                    trace the SoC's internal signals in real-time. This
                    infrastructure enables observability of the SoC's internal
                    behavior, validation of its functional design,
                    and detection of hardware and software bugs. Such tracing
                    IP blocks collect traces from several sources on the SoC
                    including the CPU, crypto coprocessors, and on-chip fabrics. Traces collected from these sources are then
                    aggregated inside trace IP block and forwarded to trace
                    sinks, such as debug-trace ports that facilitate debugging by
                    external hardware and software debuggers.
Since
                    these traces are collected from several security-sensitive
                    sources, they must be protected against untrusted
                    debuggers. If they are stored in unprotected memory, an
                    untrusted software debugger can access these traces and
                    extract secret information. Additionally, if
                    security-sensitive traces are not tagged as secure, an
                    untrusted hardware debugger might access them to extract
                    confidential information.
