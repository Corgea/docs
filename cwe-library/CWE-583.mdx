title: "CWE-583: finalize() Method Declared Public"
---

## Description
The product violates secure coding principles for mobile code by declaring a finalize() method public.

## Extended Description
A product should never call finalize explicitly, except to call super.finalize() inside an implementation of finalize(). In mobile code situations, the otherwise error prone practice of manual garbage collection can become a security threat if an attacker can maliciously invoke a finalize() method because it is declared with public access.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
