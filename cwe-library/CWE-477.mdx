## Extended Description

As programming languages evolve, functions occasionally become obsolete due to:

Advances in the language
Improved understanding of how operations should be performed effectively and securely
Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations

Functions that are removed are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some different and hopefully improved way.


## Likelihood of Exploit
