title: "CWE-1069: Empty Exception Block"
---

## Description
An invokable code block contains an exception handling block that does not contain any code, i.e. is empty.

## Extended Description
When an exception handling block (such as a Catch and Finally block) is used, but that block is empty, this can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
