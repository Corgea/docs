title: "CWE-499: Serializable Class Containing Sensitive Data"
---

## Description
The code contains a class with sensitive data, but the class does not explicitly deny serialization. The data can be accessed by serializing the class through another class.

## Extended Description
Serializable classes are effectively open classes since data cannot be hidden in them. Classes that do not explicitly deny serialization can be serialized by any other class, which can then in turn use the data stored inside it.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
