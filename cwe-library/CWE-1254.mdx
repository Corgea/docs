title: "CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity"
---

## Description
The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.

## Extended Description

Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message 
         Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is 
         implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a 
         comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly 
         the failure occurred. With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct 
         password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.
