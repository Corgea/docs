title: "CWE-581: Object Model Violation: Just One of Equals and Hashcode Defined"
---

## Description
The product does not maintain equal hashcodes for equal objects.

## Extended Description
Java objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality. One of these invariants is that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. In other words, if a.equals(b) == true then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode().

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
