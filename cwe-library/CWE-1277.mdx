title: "CWE-1277: Firmware Not Updateable"
---

## Description
The product does not provide its
			users with the ability to update or patch its
			firmware to address any vulnerabilities or
			weaknesses that may be present.

## Extended Description
Without the ability to
			patch or update firmware, consumers will be
			left vulnerable to exploitation of any known
			vulnerabilities, or any vulnerabilities that
			are discovered in the future. This can expose
			consumers to permanent risk throughout the
			entire lifetime of the device, which could be
			years or decades. Some external protective
			measures and mitigations might be employed to
			aid in preventing or reducing the risk of
			malicious attack, but the root weakness cannot
			be corrected.
