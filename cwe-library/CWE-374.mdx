title: "CWE-374: Passing Mutable Objects to an Untrusted Method"
---

## Description
The product sends non-cloned mutable data as an argument to a method or function.

## Extended Description
The function or method that has been called can alter or delete the mutable data. This could violate assumptions that the calling function has made about its state. In situations where unknown code is called with references to mutable data, this external code could make changes to the data sent. If this data was not previously cloned, the modified data might not be valid in the context of execution.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None
