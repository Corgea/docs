title: "CWE-1094: Excessive Index Range Scan for a Data Resource"
---

## Description
The product contains an index range scan for a large data table,
					but the scan can cover a large number of rows.

## Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.
While the interpretation of "large data table" and "excessive index range" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a threshold of 1000000 table rows and a threshold of 10 for the index range.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
