title: "CWE-25: Path Traversal: '/../filedir'"
---

## Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "/../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

## Extended Description

This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.
Sometimes a program checks for "../" at the beginning of the input, so a "/../" can bypass that check.


## Likelihood of Exploit
None
