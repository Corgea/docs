title: "CWE-273: Improper Check for Dropped Privileges"
---

## Description
The product attempts to drop privileges but does not check or incorrectly checks to see if the drop succeeded.

## Extended Description
If the drop fails, the product will continue to run with the raised privileges, which might provide additional access to unprivileged users.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
In Windows based environments that have access control, impersonation is used so that access checks can be performed on a client identity by a server with higher privileges. By impersonating the client, the server is restricted to client-level security -- although in different threads it may have much higher privileges.
