title: "CWE-1261: Improper Handling of Single Event Upsets"
---

## Description
The hardware logic does not effectively handle when single-event upsets (SEUs) occur.

## Extended Description

Technology trends such as CMOS-transistor down-sizing, use of 
            new materials, and system-on-chip architectures continue to increase the 
            sensitivity of systems to soft errors. These errors are random, and 
            their causes might be internal (e.g., interconnect coupling) or external 
            (e.g., cosmic radiation). These soft errors are not permanent in nature 
            and cause temporary bit flips known as single-event upsets (SEUs). 
            SEUs are induced errors in circuits caused when charged particles lose 
            energy by ionizing the medium through which they pass, leaving behind a 
            wake of electron-hole pairs that cause temporary failures. If these 
            failures occur in security-sensitive modules in a chip, it might 
            compromise the security guarantees of the chip. For instance, these 
            temporary failures could be bit flips that change the privilege of
	    a regular user to root.
