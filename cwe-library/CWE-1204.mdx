title: "CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)"
---

## Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

## Extended Description

			  By design, some cryptographic primitives
			  (such as block ciphers) require that IVs
			  must have certain properties for the
			  uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an
			  IV. Primitives may vary in how important
			  these properties are. If these properties
			  are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the
			  code, then the cryptography may be weakened
			  or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.
