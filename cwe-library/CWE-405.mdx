title: "CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)"
---

## Description
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

## Extended Description
This can lead to poor performance due to "amplification" of resource consumption, typically in a non-linear fashion.  This situation is worsened if the product allows malicious users or attackers to consume more resources than their access level permits.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
