title: "CWE-834: Excessive Iteration"
---

## Description
The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.

## Extended Description
If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
