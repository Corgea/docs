title: "CWE-336: Same Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
---

## Description
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) uses the same seed each time the product is initialized.

## Extended Description
Given the deterministic nature of PRNGs, using the same seed for each initialization will lead to the same output in the same order. If an attacker can guess (or knows) the seed, then the attacker may be able to determine the random numbers that will be produced from the PRNG.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
