## Description
The product uses a data element that has an excessively large
					number of sub-elements with non-primitive data types such as structures or aggregated objects.

## Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.
While the interpretation of "excessively large" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 sub-elements.


## Likelihood of Exploit
