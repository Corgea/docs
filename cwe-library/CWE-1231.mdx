title: "CWE-1231: Improper Prevention of Lock Bit Modification"
---

## Description
The product uses a trusted lock bit for restricting access to registers, address regions, or other resources, but the product does not prevent the value of the lock bit from being modified after it has been set.

## Extended Description

In integrated circuits and hardware
			  intellectual property (IP) cores, device configuration
			  controls are commonly programmed after a device power
			  reset by a trusted firmware or software module (e.g.,
			  BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further
			  modification.
This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit. 
			  When set, the lock bit disables writes to a protected set of
			  registers or address regions. Design or coding errors in
			  the implementation of the lock bit protection feature
			  may allow the lock bit to be modified or cleared by
			  software after it has been set. Attackers might be able to unlock the system and
			  features that the bit is intended to protect.
