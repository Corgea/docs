title: "CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
---

## Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

## Extended Description


		   PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears
		   random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on
		   cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so
		   proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the
		   PRNG.

		   Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas:
		   


		   (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key);
			 

		   (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from
		   a cryptographically secure source
			 


			   PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of
			   numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from
			   random numbers.  While the output is, in many cases,
			   sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any
			   PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as
			   input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party,
			   the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to
			   them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and
			   should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example,
			   the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the
			   approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces
			   the possible key space.
			 

			   Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.
