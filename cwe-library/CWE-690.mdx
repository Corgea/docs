title: "CWE-690: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference"
---

## Description
The product does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference.

## Extended Description
While unchecked return value weaknesses are not limited to returns of NULL pointers (see the examples in CWE-252), functions often return NULL to indicate an error status. When this error condition is not checked, a NULL pointer dereference can occur.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
