title: "CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
---

## Description
Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.

## Extended Description

While logging all information may be helpful during development stages, it is important that logging levels be set appropriately before a product ships so that sensitive user data and system information are not accidentally exposed to potential attackers.
Different log files may be produced and stored for:

Server log files (e.g. server.log).  This can give information on whatever application left the file. Usually this can give full path names and system information, and sometimes usernames and passwords.
log files that are used for debugging



## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
