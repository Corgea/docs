title: "CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression"
---

## Description
The product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.

## Extended Description

This effectively causes the regexp to accept substrings that match the pattern, which produces a partial comparison to the target. In some cases, this can lead to other weaknesses. Common errors include:

not identifying the beginning and end of the target string
using wildcards instead of acceptable character ranges
others



## Likelihood of Exploit
