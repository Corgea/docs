title: "CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes"
---

## Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

## Extended Description

If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal use, then their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability.
This weakness is sometimes known by the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible, such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection.


## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
