title: "CWE-481: Assigning instead of Comparing"
---

## Description
The code uses an operator for assignment when the intention was to perform a comparison.

## Extended Description
In many languages the compare statement is very close in appearance to the assignment statement and are often confused. This bug is generally the result of a typo and usually causes obvious problems with program execution. If the comparison is in an if statement, the if statement will usually evaluate the value of the right-hand side of the predicate.

## Likelihood of Exploit
