					commented out within its body.

## Extended Description
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.  It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
While the interpretation of "excessive volume" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default threshold of 2% of commented code.
