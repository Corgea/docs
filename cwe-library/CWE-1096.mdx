title: "CWE-1096: Singleton Class Instance Creation without Proper Locking or Synchronization"
---

## Description
The product implements a Singleton design pattern but does not use appropriate locking or other synchronization mechanism to ensure that the singleton class is only instantiated once.

## Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. by making the instantiation process non-thread-safe and introducing deadlock (CWE-833) or livelock conditions.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
