title: "CWE-1056: Invokable Control Element with Variadic Parameters"
---

## Description
A named-callable or method control element has a signature that
					supports a variable (variadic) number of parameters or arguments.

## Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.
With variadic arguments, it can be difficult or inefficient for manual analysis to be certain of which function/method is being invoked.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
