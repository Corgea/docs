title: "CWE-566: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled SQL Primary Key"
---

## Description
The product uses a database table that includes records that should not be accessible to an actor, but it executes a SQL statement with a primary key that can be controlled by that actor.

## Extended Description

When a user can set a primary key to any value, then the user can modify the key to point to unauthorized records.
Database access control errors occur when:

Data enters a program from an untrusted source.
The data is used to specify the value of a primary key in a SQL query.
The untrusted source does not have the permissions to be able to access all rows in the associated table.
