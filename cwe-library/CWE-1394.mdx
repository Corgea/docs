title: "CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key"
---

## Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

## Extended Description

	It is common practice for products to be designed to use
	default keys.  The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing
	process or the system administrator's task of installation and
	deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not
	change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass
	authentication quickly across multiple organizations.
