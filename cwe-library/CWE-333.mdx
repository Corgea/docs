title: "CWE-333: Improper Handling of Insufficient Entropy in TRNG"
---

## Description
True random number generators (TRNG) generally have a limited source of entropy and therefore can fail or block.

## Extended Description
The rate at which true random numbers can be generated is limited. It is important that one uses them only when they are needed for security.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
