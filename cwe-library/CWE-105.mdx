title: "CWE-105: Struts: Form Field Without Validator"
---

## Description
The product has a form field that is not validated by a corresponding validation form, which can introduce other weaknesses related to insufficient input validation.

## Extended Description
Omitting validation for even a single input field may give attackers the leeway they need to compromise the product. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
