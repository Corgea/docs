title: "CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials"
---

## Description
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

## Extended Description

	It is common practice for products to be designed to use
	default keys, passwords, or other mechanisms for
	authentication.  The rationale is to simplify the
	manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of
	installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if
	admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers
	to bypass authentication quickly across multiple
	organizations.
