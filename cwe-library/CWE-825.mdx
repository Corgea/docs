title: "CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference"
---

## Description
The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.

## Extended Description
When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.

## Likelihood of Exploit
