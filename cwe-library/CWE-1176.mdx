title: "CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation"
---

## Description
The product performs CPU computations using
         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the
         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be
         optimized further.

## Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly, possibly in ways that are noticeable to the users.  If an attacker can influence the amount of computation that must be performed, e.g. by triggering worst-case complexity, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.


## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
