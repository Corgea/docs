title: "CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints"
---

## Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

## Extended Description

Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.
While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.


## Likelihood of Exploit
None
