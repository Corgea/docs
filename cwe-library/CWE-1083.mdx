title: "CWE-1083: Data Access from Outside Expected Data Manager Component"
---

## Description
The product is intended to manage data access through a particular data manager component such as a relational or non-SQL database, but it contains code that performs data access operations without using that component.

## Extended Description
When the product has a data access component, the design may be intended to handle all data access operations through that component.  If a data access operation is performed outside of that component, then this may indicate a violation of the intended design.
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None
