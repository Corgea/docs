title: "CWE-779: Logging of Excessive Data"
---

## Description
The product logs too much information, making log files hard to process and possibly hindering recovery efforts or forensic analysis after an attack.

## Extended Description
While logging is a good practice in general, and very high levels of logging are appropriate for debugging stages of development, too much logging in a production environment might hinder a system administrator's ability to detect anomalous conditions. This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None
