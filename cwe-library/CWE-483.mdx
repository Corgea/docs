title: "CWE-483: Incorrect Block Delimitation"
---

## Description
The code does not explicitly delimit a block that is intended to contain 2 or more statements, creating a logic error.

## Extended Description
In some languages, braces (or other delimiters) are optional for blocks. When the delimiter is omitted, it is possible to insert a logic error in which a statement is thought to be in a block but is not. In some cases, the logic error can have security implications.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
