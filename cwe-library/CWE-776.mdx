title: "CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')"
---

## Description
The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.

## Extended Description
If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
