title: "CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
---

## Description
A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

## Extended Description
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
Phishing is a general term for deceptive attempts to coerce private information from users that will be used for identity theft.
