title: "CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource"
---

## Description
The product does not properly maintain a reference to a resource that has been allocated, which prevents the resource from being reclaimed.

## Extended Description
This does not necessarily apply in languages or frameworks that automatically perform garbage collection, since the removal of all references may act as a signal that the resource is ready to be reclaimed.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
