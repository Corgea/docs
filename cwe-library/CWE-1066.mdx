## Description
The product contains a serializable data element that does not
					have an associated serialization method.

## Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. by triggering an exception.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.
As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java.
