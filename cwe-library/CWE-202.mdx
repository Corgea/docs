title: "CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries"
---

## Description
When trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.

## Extended Description
In situations where data should not be tied to individual users, but a large number of users should be able to make queries that "scrub" the identity of users, it may be possible to get information about a user -- e.g., by specifying search terms that are known to be unique to that user.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
