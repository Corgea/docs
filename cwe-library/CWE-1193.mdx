title: "CWE-1193: Power-On of Untrusted Execution Core Before Enabling Fabric Access Control"
---

## Description
The product enables components that contain untrusted firmware before memory and fabric access controls have been enabled.

## Extended Description


	   After initial reset, System-on-Chip (SoC) fabric access controls and other
           security features need to be programmed by trusted firmware as part
           of the boot sequence. If untrusted IPs or peripheral microcontrollers
	   are enabled first, then the untrusted component can master
           transactions on the hardware bus and target memory or other assets to
           compromise the SoC boot firmware.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
