title: "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
---

## Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

## Extended Description

When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.
Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.
