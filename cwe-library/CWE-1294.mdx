title: "CWE-1294: Insecure Security Identifier Mechanism"
---

## Description
The System-on-Chip (SoC) implements a Security Identifier mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Identifiers are not correctly implemented.

## Extended Description

Systems-On-Chip (Integrated circuits and hardware
                    engines) implement Security Identifiers to
                    differentiate/identify actions originated from various
                    agents. These actions could be 'read', 'write', 'program',
                    'reset', 'fetch', 'compute', etc. Security identifiers are
                    generated and assigned to every agent in the System (SoC)
                    that is either capable of generating an action or receiving
                    an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned
                    a unique, Security Identifier based on its trust level or
                    privileges.
A broad class of flaws can exist in the Security
                    Identifier process, including but not limited to missing
                    security identifiers, improper conversion of security
                    identifiers, incorrect generation of security identifiers,
                    etc.
