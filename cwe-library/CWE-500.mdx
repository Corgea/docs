title: "CWE-500: Public Static Field Not Marked Final"
---

## Description
An object contains a public static field that is not marked final, which might allow it to be modified in unexpected ways.

## Extended Description

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
When a field is declared public but not final, the field can be read and written to by arbitrary Java code.
