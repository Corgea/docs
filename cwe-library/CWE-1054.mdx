title: "CWE-1054: Invocation of a Control Element at an Unnecessarily Deep Horizontal Layer"
---

## Description
The code at one architectural layer invokes code that resides
					at a deeper layer than the adjacent layer, i.e., the invocation skips at least one
					layer, and the invoked code is not part of a vertical utility layer that can be referenced from any horizontal layer.

## Extended Description
This issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.  It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
