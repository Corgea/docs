title: "CWE-1122: Excessive Halstead Complexity"
---

## Description
The code is structured in a way that a Halstead complexity
					measure exceeds a desirable maximum.

## Extended Description
A variety of Halstead complexity measures exist, such as program vocabulary size or volume.
This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.  It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
