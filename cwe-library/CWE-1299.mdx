title: "CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface"
---

## Description
The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed against the primary path.

## Extended Description

An asset inside a chip might have access-control
                    protections through one interface. However, if all paths to
                    the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise
                    the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths
                    could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP
                    core, or could be paths from other external-facing
                    interfaces to the IP core or SoC.
Consider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART,
                    SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for
                    SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then
                    an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers
                    through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such
                    as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. 
Alternatively, attackers might be able to bypass
                    existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow
                    registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically
                    refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple
                    addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored
                    address has the same effect as writing to the address of
                    the main register. They are typically implemented within an
                    IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data
                    will later be updated to the main register, and both
                    registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not
                    access-protected, attackers could simply initiate
                    transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system
                    security.
