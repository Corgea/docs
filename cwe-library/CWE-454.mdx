title: "CWE-454: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores"
---

## Description
The product initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.

## Extended Description

The variables may have been initialized incorrectly. If an attacker can initialize the variable, then they can influence what the vulnerable system will do.
