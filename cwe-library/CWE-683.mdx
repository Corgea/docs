title: "CWE-683: Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments"
---

## Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the arguments in an incorrect order, leading to resultant weaknesses.

## Extended Description
While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the called function accepts variable numbers or types of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in languages or environments that do not enforce strong typing.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
