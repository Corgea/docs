title: "CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point"
---

## Description
The product opens a file or directory, but it does not properly prevent the name from being associated with a junction or mount point to a destination that is outside of the intended control sphere.

## Extended Description

Depending on the intended action
			  being performed, this could allow an
			  attacker to cause the product to read,
			  write, delete, or otherwise operate on
			  unauthorized files.
In Windows, NTFS5 allows for file
			  system objects called reparse points.
			  Applications can create a hard link from one
			  directory to another directory, called a
			  junction point. They can also create a
			  mapping from a directory to a drive letter,
			  called a mount point. If a file is used by a
			  privileged program, but it can be replaced
			  with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g.,
			  AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate
			  privileges. When the process opens the file,
			  the attacker can assume the privileges of
			  that process, tricking the privileged
			  process to read, modify, or delete the
			  sensitive file, preventing the program from
			  accurately processing data. Note that one
			  can also point to registries and
			  semaphores.
