title: "CWE-170: Improper Null Termination"
---

## Description
The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.

## Extended Description
Null termination errors frequently occur in two different ways. An off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible.

## Likelihood of Exploit
