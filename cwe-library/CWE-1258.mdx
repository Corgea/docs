title: "CWE-1258: Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information"
---

## Description
The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered.

## Extended Description

Security sensitive values, keys, intermediate steps of cryptographic operations, etc. are stored in temporary registers in the hardware. If these values are not cleared when debug mode is entered they may be accessed by a debugger allowing sensitive information to be accessible by untrusted parties.


## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
