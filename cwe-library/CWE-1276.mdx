title: "CWE-1276: Hardware Child Block Incorrectly Connected to Parent System"
---

## Description
Signals between a hardware IP and the parent system design are incorrectly connected causing security risks.

## Extended Description

Individual hardware IP must communicate with the parent system in order for the product to function correctly and as intended. If implemented incorrectly, while not causing any apparent functional issues, may cause security issues. For example, if the IP should only be reset by a system-wide hard reset, but instead the reset input is connected to a software-triggered debug mode reset (which is also asserted during a hard reset), integrity of data inside the IP can be violated.


## Likelihood of Exploit
