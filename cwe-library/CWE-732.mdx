title: "CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
---

## Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

## Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.
