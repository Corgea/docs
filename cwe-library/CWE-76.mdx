title: "CWE-76: Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements"
---

## Description
The product correctly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes equivalent special elements.

## Extended Description
The product may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the product may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a dangerous "-e" command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for "--exec" or other switches that have the same semantics.

## Likelihood of Exploit
