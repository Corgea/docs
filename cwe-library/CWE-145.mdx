title: "CWE-145: Improper Neutralization of Section Delimiters"
---

## Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as section delimiters when they are sent to a downstream component.

## Extended Description

As data is parsed, an injected/absent/malformed delimiter may cause the process to take unexpected actions.
One example of a section delimiter is the boundary string in a multipart MIME message. In many cases, doubled line delimiters can serve as a section delimiter.


## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
