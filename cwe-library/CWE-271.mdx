title: "CWE-271: Privilege Dropping / Lowering Errors"

## Description
The product does not drop privileges before passing control of a resource to an actor that does not have those privileges.

## Extended Description
In some contexts, a system executing with elevated permissions will hand off a process/file/etc. to another process or user. If the privileges of an entity are not reduced, then elevated privileges are spread throughout a system and possibly to an attacker.

## Likelihood of Exploit
