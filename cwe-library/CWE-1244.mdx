title: "CWE-1244: Internal Asset Exposed to Unsafe Debug Access Level or State"
---

## Description
The product uses physical debug or test
        interfaces with support for multiple access levels, but it
        assigns the wrong debug access level to an internal asset,
        providing unintended access to the asset from untrusted debug
        agents.

## Extended Description

Debug authorization can have multiple levels of
	  access, defined such that different system internal assets
	  are accessible based on the current authorized debug
	  level. Other than debugger authentication (e.g., using
	  passwords or challenges), the authorization can also be
	  based on the system state or boot stage. For example, full
	  system debug access might only be allowed early in boot
	  after a system reset to ensure that previous session data is
	  not accessible to the authenticated debugger.
If this protection mechanism does not ensure that
          internal assets have the correct debug access level during
          each boot stage or change in system state, an attacker could
          obtain sensitive information from the internal asset using a
          debugger.
