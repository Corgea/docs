title: "CWE-1332: Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips"
---

## Description
The device is missing or incorrectly implements circuitry or sensors that detect and mitigate the skipping of security-critical CPU instructions when they occur.

## Extended Description

The operating conditions of hardware may change
              in ways that cause unexpected behavior to occur,
              including the skipping of security-critical CPU
              instructions. Generally, this can occur due to
              electrical disturbances or when the device operates
              outside of its expected conditions.
In practice, application code may contain
			  conditional branches that are security-sensitive (e.g.,
			  accepting or rejecting a user-provided password). These
			  conditional branches are typically implemented by a
			  single conditional branch instruction in the program
			  binary which, if skipped, may lead to effectively
			  flipping the branch condition - i.e., causing the wrong
			  security-sensitive branch to be taken. This affects
			  processes such as firmware authentication, password
			  verification, and other security-sensitive decision
			  points.
Attackers can use fault injection techniques to
			  alter the operating conditions of hardware so that
			  security-critical instructions are skipped more
			  frequently or more reliably than they would in a
			  "natural" setting.
