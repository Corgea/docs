title: "CWE-1393: Use of Default Password"
---

## Description
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

## Extended Description

	It is common practice for products to be designed to use
	default passwords for authentication.  The rationale is to
	simplify the manufacturing process or the system
	administrator's task of installation and deployment into an
	enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults,
	then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass
	authentication across multiple organizations. There are many
	lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools
	that are easily available from the World Wide Web.
