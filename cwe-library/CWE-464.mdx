title: "CWE-464: Addition of Data Structure Sentinel"
---

## Description
The accidental addition of a data-structure sentinel can cause serious programming logic problems.

## Extended Description
Data-structure sentinels are often used to mark the structure of data. A common example of this is the null character at the end of strings or a special sentinel to mark the end of a linked list. It is dangerous to allow this type of control data to be easily accessible. Therefore, it is important to protect from the addition or modification of sentinels.
