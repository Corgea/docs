title: "CWE-1304: Improperly Preserved Integrity of Hardware Configuration State During a Power Save/Restore Operation"
---

## Description
The product performs a power save/restore
            operation, but it does not ensure that the integrity of
            the configuration state is maintained and/or verified between
	    the beginning and ending of the operation.

## Extended Description

Before powering down, the Intellectual
                Property (IP) saves current state (S) to persistent
                storage such as flash or always-on memory in order to
                optimize the restore operation.  During this process,
                an attacker with access to the persistent storage may
                alter (S) to a configuration that could potentially
                modify privileges, disable protections, and/or cause
                damage to the hardware. If the IP does not validate
                the configuration state stored in persistent memory,
                upon regaining power or becoming operational again,
                the IP could be compromised through the activation of
                an unwanted/harmful configuration.
