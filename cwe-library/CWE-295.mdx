title: "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation"
---

## Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

## Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
A certificate is a token that associates an identity (principal) to a cryptographic key. Certificates can be used to check if a public key belongs to the assumed owner.
