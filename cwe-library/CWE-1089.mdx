title: "CWE-1089: Large Data Table with Excessive Number of Indices"
---

## Description
The product uses a large data table that contains an excessively large number of
					indices.

## Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.
While the interpretation of "large data table" and "excessively large number of indices" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default threshold of 1000000 rows for a "large" table and a default threshold of 3 indices.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
