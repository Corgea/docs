title: "CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default"
---

## Description
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

## Extended Description
Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value.  However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.
