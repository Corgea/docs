title: "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password"
---

## Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

## Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.
