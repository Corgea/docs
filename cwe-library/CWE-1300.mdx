title: "CWE-1300: Improper Protection of Physical Side Channels"
---

## Description
The device does not contain sufficient protection
	mechanisms to prevent physical side channels from exposing
	sensitive information due to patterns in physically observable
	phenomena such as variations in power consumption,
	electromagnetic emissions (EME), or acoustic emissions.

## Extended Description

An adversary could monitor and measure physical
	  phenomena to detect patterns and make inferences, even if it
	  is not possible to extract the information in the digital
	  domain.
Physical side channels have been well-studied for
	  decades in the context of breaking implementations of
	  cryptographic algorithms or other attacks against security
	  features. These side channels may be easily observed by an
	  adversary with physical access to the device, or using a
	  tool that is in close proximity.  If the adversary can
	  monitor hardware operation and correlate its data processing
	  with power, EME, and acoustic measurements, the adversary
	  might be able to recover of secret keys and data.
