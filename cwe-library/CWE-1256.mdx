title: "CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features"
---

## Description
The product provides software-controllable
			device functionality for capabilities such as power and
			clock management, but it does not properly limit
			functionality that can lead to modification of
			hardware memory or register bits, or the ability to
			observe physical side channels.

## Extended Description

It is frequently assumed that physical attacks
              such as fault injection and side-channel analysis
              require an attacker to have physical access to the
              target device.  This assumption may be false if the
              device has improperly secured power management features,
              or similar features.  For mobile devices, minimizing
              power consumption is critical, but these devices run a
              wide variety of applications with different performance
              requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to
              dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and
              monitor power consumption are common features in today's
              chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault
              injection and side-channel attacks without having
              physical access to the device.
Fault injection attacks involve strategic
              manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired
              effect such as skipping an authentication step,
              elevating privileges, or altering the output of a
              cryptographic operation.  Manipulation of the device
              clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to
              inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical
              device access.  Poorly protected power management
              features allow these attacks to be performed from
              software.  Other features, such as the ability to write
              repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged
              software, can result in bit flips in other memory
              locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).
Side channel analysis requires gathering
			  measurement traces of physical quantities such as power
			  consumption.  Modern processors often include power
			  metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g.,
			  Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable
			  attackers to gather measurements necessary for
			  performing side-channel attacks from software.
