title: "CWE-551: Incorrect Behavior Order: Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization"
---

## Description
If a web server does not fully parse requested URLs before it examines them for authorization, it may be possible for an attacker to bypass authorization protection.

## Extended Description
For instance, the character strings /./ and / both mean current directory. If /SomeDirectory is a protected directory and an attacker requests /./SomeDirectory, the attacker may be able to gain access to the resource if /./ is not converted to / before the authorization check is performed.

## Likelihood of Exploit
None

## Background Detail
None
