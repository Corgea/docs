title: "CWE-7: J2EE Misconfiguration: Missing Custom Error Page"
---

## Description
The default error page of a web application should not display sensitive information about the product.

## Extended Description

A Web application must define a default error page for 4xx errors (e.g. 404), 5xx (e.g. 500) errors and catch java.lang.Throwable exceptions to prevent attackers from mining information from the application container's built-in error response.
When an attacker explores a web site looking for vulnerabilities, the amount of information that the site provides is crucial to the eventual success or failure of any attempted attacks.
