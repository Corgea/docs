description: 'Detect and secure hardcoded secrets in your codebase'

## Overview

Secret scanning is a critical security capability within Corgea's AI-native SAST that identifies hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, and other sensitive information in your codebase. By detecting secrets before they reach production, you can prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations.

Unlike traditional secret scanners that rely solely on pattern matching, Corgea's secret scanning uses a combination of pattern matching, entropy analysis, and AI-powered contextual understanding to minimize false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## How It Works

Corgea's secret scanner analyzes your entire codebase to identify potential secrets through multiple techniques:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pattern Matching">
    Identifies known secret formats using an extensive library of patterns for popular services and platforms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Entropy Analysis">
    Detects high-entropy strings that may indicate randomly generated keys, tokens, or passwords.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contextual Understanding">
    Uses AI to understand the context around potential secrets, reducing false positives from test data, examples, or placeholders.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Detected Secret Types

Corgea's secret scanner can detect a wide range of secret types across different platforms and services:
