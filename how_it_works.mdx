## Overview of Corgea
Corgea is an AI security platform that finds, triages and fixes insecure code. 

## How Corgea Works
Corgea's process involves several key steps:

1. Scanning: Corgea scans your code repositories using our BLAST scanner. 
2. Vulnerability Consumption: Corgea can also consume vulnerability reports from integrated SAST tools.
3. AI-Powered Remediation: The AI engine analyzes these vulnerabilities and generates appropriate fixes.
4. Contextual Understanding: Corgea is equipped with extensive context for CWEs and has certifications for languages like Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
5. Issuing Fixes via GitHub: The tool uses its GitHub application to issue pull requests with these fixes, streamlining the remediation process.
